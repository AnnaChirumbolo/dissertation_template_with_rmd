# Conclusion

The conclusion section should specify the key findings of your study, explain their wider significance in the context of the research field and explain how you have filled the knowledge gap that you have identified in the introduction. This is your chance to present to your reader the major take-home messages of your dissertation research. It should be similar in content to the last sentence of your summary abstract. It should not be a repetition of the first paragraph of the discussion. They can be distinguished in their connection to broader issues. The first paragraph of the discussion will tend to focus on the direct scientific implications of your work (i.e. basic science, fundamental knowledge) while the conclusion will tend to focus more on the implications of the results for society, conservation, etc.
