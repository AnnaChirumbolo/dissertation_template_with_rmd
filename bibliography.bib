	abstract = {Several weaknesses in our understanding of long-lived animal populations have persisted, mainly due to a prevalence of studies of a single local population at the expense of multisite studies. We performed a multisite capture–mark–resight analysis using 2050 Atlantic Puffins (Fratercula arctica) banded as chicks on four islands (colonies) over 24 years in the Gulf of Maine, {USA} and Canada. Within program {MARK}, encounter, apparent survival, pre-breeding movement ({PBM}; annual movements between colonies prior to breeding), and natal dispersal ({ND}) probabilities were modeled as functions of age, colony, and several covariates. Information-theoretic model selection criteria and estimated model effect sizes were used to identify important effects and select models to estimate parameters. Encounter probabilities were extremely variable (0.10–0.95) and declined annually starting six years after bands were applied, due to changes in resighting effort, and band wear, respectively. Colony-dependent survival probabilities increased to a peak at age six years; arithmetic means from all colonies were: 0.70 for age 0–3, 0.78 for age 4, 0.81 for age 5, and 0.84 for age 6–8 years. Low adult survival (age ≥5 years) may reflect inclusion of breeding and nonbreeding adults in our sample or a bias due to band loss and illegibility. Consistent with a density-dependent prediction, the effect of colony size on survival was negative and acquired strong {AICc} support. However, this effect was inconsistent with strata effects in competing top models; the latter suggest that survival was lowest on the smallest island. The effects of origin and destination colony and origin colony size in {PBM} and {ND} probabilities resulted in important variation in these parameters. As few as 8\% and as many as 57\% of the puffins that we marked may have bred away from their natal colony, a signal of highly variable philopatry. Consistent with the conspecific attraction hypothesis, {ND} and {PBM} probabilities declined as the size of the origin colony increased. {PBM} probabilities were highest in the age 0–3 period, and these declined quickly with age thereafter. Strong colony and age effects in {ND} and {PMB} probabilities identify movement as a critical contributor to local population dynamics at our four study sites.},

	abstract = {We radio-tagged and followed the movements of six Common Murres (Uria aalge), three Razorbills (Alca torda) and one Atlantic Puffin (Fratercula arctica) that were feeding young, and two Common Murres that were incubating on the Isle of May, Firth of Forth, Scotland. While there was some overlap in feeding areas among the three species, there were also marked differences. Razorbills were more likely to feed well away from the colony and, in contrast to Common Murres and the Atlantic Puffin, rarely dived close to the island. Razorbills appeared to favor areas of relatively shallow water. Individual birds did not show strong fidelity to a particular feeding area, nor did the location of feeding areas change on a day-to-day basis.},
