# Bibliography 

Write your references here.

Unfortunately there is no way to synchronise the text with the references on Rmarkdown. I would suggest you write this file when you are sure it is 100% finalised and ready to be submitted. So that you can just paste in your text and your bibliography without any changes needed.
